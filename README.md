## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying images accurately. The model has been trained and tested on a labeled dataset and can predict the category of new, unseen images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains images labeled into various categories. It is split into training, validation, and test sets to assess the modelâ€™s performance accurately. If using an external dataset, please ensure it is available in the correct format.

## Installation
#### 1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/VyshnaviVunnamatla/Image-Classification.git cd Image-Classification

#### 2. Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes all necessary libraries, such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and matplotlib.

## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the image dataset (training, validation, and testing folders).
- src/: Contains scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- models/: Saved models and checkpoints.
- requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
- README.md: Project documentation.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with layers optimized for image classification tasks:
- #### Convolutional Layers :
  Extract spatial features from the images.
- #### Fully Connected Layers:
  Generate final predictions based on learned features.

## Example Architecture
    Input -> Conv2D -> Pooling -> Conv2D -> Pooling -> Flatten -> Dense -> Output
You may adjust the architecture based on your dataset and performance requirements.    
    
## Training   
1. Preprocess the data: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model robustness.
2. Train the model: Run the training script to train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
   
       python src/train.py
3. Evaluation: After training, evaluate the model on the test set to measure its accuracy.

## Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters include:

- Learning rate
- Batch size
- Epochs
- Optimizer type (e.g., Adam, SGD)

## Future Work
Potential improvements include:

- Using a more complex model: Implement architectures like ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- Data Augmentation: Experiment with additional augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
